TODO
====


* (hard) import ABR from some path configurations
* generate_one's tooltip says that we render one dataset frame for the
  currently active camera. What if the active camera is not selected for
  dataset generation? Solution: pass a temporary configuration to the
  backend with the active camera as target camera
* make installable Addon
  - gracefully handle incorrect ABR path, maybe with reduced functionality
* provide `abr_gui.zip` file



DONE
====
* integrate `abr_gui` documentation into ABR's docs
